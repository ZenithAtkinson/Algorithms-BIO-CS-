Setting the Project: The Great Learning (Daxue %!)

The Great Learning Kt, the seminal, foundational canon that sets
and anchors this Confucian project early in the tradition, describes the
process of becoming human, It insists that it is only through committing
oneself to a resolute regimen of personal cultivation that one can achieve
the comprehensive intellectual and moral understanding that will make
the most of the human experience. The central message of this terse
yet comprehensive document is that while personal, familial, social

political, and indeed cosmic cultivation is ultimately coterminous and
‘mutually entailing, it must always begin from a commitment to personal

in things and a beginning and an end in what we do, Ie isin realizing what
should have priotity that one approaches the proper way (dao). ""

Having endorsed the priority of making a commitment to personal
cultivation, the text then continues by rehearsing the cosmic proportions
the ancient sage-kings were able to achieve once they dedicated
themselves to this project:

‘The ancients who sought to demonstrate real excellence to the whole world
firse brought proper order to their states; in seeking to bring proper order
to their states, they first set their families right; in secking to set their
families right, they first cultivated their own persons; in secking to cultivate
their persons, they first knew what is proper in their own heartmindss
proper in their heartminds, they first became

sincere in their purposes; in seeking to become sincere in their purposes,
they first became comprehensive in their wisdom, And the highest wisdom
lies in seeing how things fit ogether most productively.

Once they saw how things fie together most productively, cheir wisdom
reached its heights; once their wisdom reached its heights, their choughts
were sincere; once their thoughts were sincere, their heartminds knew what
is proper; once their heartminds knew what is proper, their persons were
cultivated; once their persons were cultivated, their families were set rights
once their families were set right, their state was properly ordereds and once
their states were properly ordered, there was peace in the world."

Bach person stands as a unique perspective on family, community,
polity, and cosmos, and through a dedication to deliberate growth and
articulation, everyone has the possibility of bringing the resolution of
the relationships that locate and constitute them within family and
community into clearer and more meaningful focus. The “learning” (xue

are not properly set, and it would never do for priorities to be reversed
between what should be invested with importance and what should be
treated more lightly."

The Book of Rites (Liji MEH) version of the Great Learning concludes
this text by declaring that giving priority to achieving personal excellence
is wisdom at its best. In its own words:

This commitment to personal cultivation is called both the root and the
height of wisdom."

Here again, the “root” and its product, wisdom, ate to be perceived as an
organic whole that grow together of not at all.

Th appealing to an understanding of Chinese natural cosmology
as the relevant interpretive context for this Confucian project, I have
tried to provide a language that will distinguish this worldview from the
reductive, single-ordered, “One-behind-the-many” ontological model
that grounds classical Greek metaphysical thinking wherein one comes
to “understand” the many by knowing retrospectively the foundational
and causal ideal that lies behind them. Instead, we have found that in
Chinese correlative cosmology there is a symbiotic and holistic focus-field
model of order that is illustrated rather concisely here in the organic,
ecological sensibilities of the Great Learning. The meaning of the family
is implicated in and dependent upon the productive cultivation of each
of its members, and by extension, the meaning of the entire cosmos is
implicated in and dependent upon the productive cultivation of each
person within family and community. Personal worth is the source of
human culture, and human culture in turn is the aggregating resource
that provides a context for each person's cultivation.

While certainly having important theoretical implications, the
enduring power of this Confucian project is that it proceeds from a
relatively straightforward account of the actual human experience, It

III + The Confucian Project: taining Relational Virtuasty 95

Confucius develops his insights around the most basic and enduring
aspects of the ordinary human experience—family reverence, deference
to others, friendship, a cultivated sense of shame, growth and education,
life in community, and so on—and in so doing, he has guaranteed theit
continuing relevance, One characteristic of Confucianism prominent
in the words of Confucius himself that has made his teachings so
resilient in the Chinese tradition is its porousness and adaptability. His
contribution was simply to take ownership of the cultural legacy of
his time, to adapt the wisdom of the past to his own present historical
moment, and then to recommend to future generations that they
do the same."

‘The personal model of Confucius that is remembered in the
Analects does not purport to lay out some generic formula by which
everyone should live their lives. Rather, the text recalls the natrative of
one special petson: how he in his relations with others cultivated his
humanity, and how he lived a fulfilled and a fulfilling life, much to
the admiration of those around him, We might take liberties and play
with the title of the Analects, reading “discoursing” (Junyu fii) more
specifically as “tole-based discoursing” (Junyu {étif). Indeed, in reading
the Analects, we encounter the relationally constituted Confucius making
his way through life by living his many roles as best he can: as a caring
family member (5.1, 5.2), as a strict teacher and mentor (16.13), as
a scrupulous and incorruptible scholar-official (15.1), as a concerned
neighbor and member of the community (9.10), as an always-critical
political consultant (12.18), as the grateful progeny of his progenitors
(75), as an enthusiastic heir to a specific cultural legacy (3.14, 9.5),
indeed, as a member of a chorus of joyful boys and men singing their
way home after a happy day on the river Yi (11.26). He offers us
historical models rather than principles, and exhortations rather than
imperatives. ‘The power and lasting value of his insights lie in the fact
that, as I will endeavor to show, thése ideas ate intuitively persuasive,
